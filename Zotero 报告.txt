    摘要 	Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has emerged as a
    powerful technique for bacterial detection, offering high
    sensitivity and molecular-level specificity. However, conventional
    label-free SERS methods relie on the spontaneous adsorption of
    limited chemical components onto the SERS substrate. Here we
    developed a multidimensional SERS biosensor capable of capturing
    more comprehensive information through substrate surface
    modifications. By employing molecular modifiers with distinct
    chemical characteristics, we modulated the selective adsorption
    behaviors of bacterial components, enhancing the diversity of
    physicochemical interactions at the sensing interface. The
    physicochemical properties of the nanomaterials were characterized
    using UV–vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
    dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential analysis. A
    database comprising 119,000 SERS profiles from 17 bacterial strains
    across seven dimensions was constructed. The 1D-convolutional neural
    network (1D-CNN) model was utilized to analyze 127 dimensional
    combinations, achieving a maximum accuracy of 99.29 %. The results
    demonstrate the capability of the multidimensional SERS biosensor to
    enhance bacterial identification accuracy by leveraging the rich
    biochemical diversity captured across multiple dimensions.
    Nevertheless, optimization of the dimensionality is necessary to
    mitigate problems such as redundancy and overfitting during data
    processing.

    摘要 	Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) as two typical
    greenhouse gases, have important effects on global climate change.
    In this paper, an external cavity quantum cascade laser (ECQCL)
    based gas sensor was developed for simultaneous CH4 and N2O
    detection by employing calibration-free direct absorption
    spectroscopy. In view of the important influence of spectral noise
    and background normalization process on gas concentration inversion,
    dual-convolutional neural networks (D-CNN) and baseline
    normalization algorithms were developed for spectral signal
    de-noising and concentration inversion, respectively. Compared to
    traditional methods, the results indicate that the proposed D-CNN
    de-noising algorithm can successfully improve the signal-to-noise
    ratio (SNR) by 2.37 times, and the correlation coefficients of the
    retrieved concentrations were improved from 0.9965 to 0.9991 for CH4
    and 0.9983 to 0.9994 for N2O, respectively, which shows a great
    potential for analyzing unresolved mixture absorption spectra with
    high-precision and accuracy in simultaneous detection of multiple
    gas components.

    摘要 	Highly sensitive standoff methane detection is vital for
    atmospheric science, environmental protection, and production
    safety. We develop a mid-infrared methane standoff sensor using a
    cooperative target based on tunable diode laser absorption
    spectroscopy (TDLAS). To enhance sensor sensitivity, we propose a
    onedimensional frequency channel attention-based convolutional
    neural network (1D-FCACNN) filter, which can effectively denoise the
    methane absorbance signals and its second harmonic signals. The
    filter model is adequately trained on a simulated spectrum dataset,
    which we constructed based on data augmentation. In comparison with
    reported filtering algorithms, the proposed filter shows the best
    performance in both measuring modes and evaluation metrics.
    Real-time measurements show that the measuring accuracy and limit of
    detection (LOD) of the proposed sensor reach a minimum of 30.40 ppb
    and 5.04 ppb over a 10-meter optical range, a significant
    improvement compared to previous reports of methane standoff
    sensors. The proposed methane standoff sensor proves the feasibility
    of enhancing the performance of TDLAS gas sensors with the attention
    mechanism, bringing a new option for high-sensitivity measurements
    of methane and other atmospheric trace gases.

    摘要 	There are two primary methods to address metal oxide
    semiconductor sensor’s poor selectivity issues, dynamic testing and
    constructing sensor arrays. The integration of sensor array with
    convolutional neural network (CNN) has exhibited tremendous
    potential in the direction of gas mixture identification. However,
    the utilization of sensor arrays often leads to increased costs,
    complexity, and elevated failure rates. Hence, in this work, we
    amalgamated CNN and single sensor’s dynamic testing methodologies to
    conduct qualitative and quantitative identification of
    methanol-ethanol mixtures. The acquisition of dynamic response data
    was achieved through temperature modulation. Prudent adjustments to
    the heating waveform and associated parameters extended the
    one-dimensional information inherent in gas sensitive response,
    effectively addressing the challenges of poor selectivity
    encountered in metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors. Subsequently,
    two CNNs were harnessed for the categorization and concentration
    prognosis of mixed gases. The utilization of a two-dimensional CNN
    for recognizing data transformed by the gramian angular field
    resulted in the highest classification accuracy of 99.33 %.
    Furthermore, one-dimensional CNN exhibited minimal errors when
    estimating the concentrations of both components within the mixture.
    Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve
    the classification and concentration prediction of binary mixed
    gases with high precision, potentially emerging as a novel strategy
    to resolve gas mixture identification challenges.

        Differential absorption geometric invariants combined with
        convolutional neural network: A method for ppb-level breath
        nitric oxide detection

    摘要 	Ultraviolet differential optical absorption spectroscopy
    (UV-DOAS) enables early diagnosis of respiratory infections by
    detecting nitric oxide (NO) in breath. However, the baseline drift
    of the NO absorption spectra and the weak absorption features at
    ultra-low concentrations impede accurate detection. Here, we present
    an optical sensor for breath NO detection based on differential
    absorption geometric invariants (DAGIs) and convolutional neural
    network (CNN). On the one hand, the concept of DAGIs is proposed to
    enhance absorption feature, which also addresses the baseline drift
    and facilitates concentration inversion by utilizing relative
    absorption intensity. Specifically, we construct geometries that
    remain constant with respect to the baseline during the differential
    process based on absorption features, and derive their geometric
    parameters as DAGIs. Geometric triangles are constructed as
    geometries of NO discrete peak absorption features using this
    concept. On the other hand, we proposed a Geometric-CNN model for
    the ultra-low NO concentration inversion by fusing the features of
    the differential absorption spectra with DAGIs. Laboratory results
    demonstrate that our sensor has outstanding realtime and stability
    performance, effectively addresses the baseline drift and achieves a
    detection limit of 0.85 parts per billion (ppb) determined by
    Allan’s variance. And actual tests demonstrated our sensor can
    detect breath NO at the ppb level with excellent repeatability.
    Compared to conventional optical methods that focus only on the
    direct absorption features of the spectra, our sensor leverages the
    geometric features that represent the relative absorption intensity
    for NO concentration inversion with lower detection limits.

    摘要 	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are revolutionizing
    agriculture, finding widespread applications in tasks such as crop
    disease detection and yield prediction. However, their high accuracy
    ability often requires significant computational and memory
    resources, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained
    edge devices. Lightweight CNNs can reduce computational requirements
    but still encounter substantial memory access challenges,
    necessitating further optimization for practical edge deployment.
    Therefore, this study employed MobileNetV2 for rice leaf disease
    classification and adapt the model for edge computing by quantizing
    network parameters to 16-bit for Field-Programmable Gate Array
    (FPGA) storage, implementing a linear buffering method to reduce
    parameter read operations, thus alleviating communication bandwidth
    bottlenecks and improving memory utilization by 28.6 %. High Level
    Synthesis (HLS) tools were also applied to optimize the FPGA
    accelerator through loop unrolling, pipelining, and matrix
    partitioning, enhancing data parallelism and reuse. The optimized
    design was deployed on a ZYNQ-AC7Z020 FPGA platform, achieving 95.8
    % classification accuracy, an inference speed of 53 ms per frame,
    power consumption of 3.09 W, and a throughput of 35.7 GOPS (Giga
    Operations Per Second). Memory usage was reduced by 47.1 % without
    compromising performance. This cost-effective and efficient design
    offers a robust solution for real-time rice leaf disease
    classification, balancing resource constraints and operational
    performance for edge applications in precision agriculture.

    摘要 	Recent years have witnessed the splendid performance of deep
    learning methods used in gas recognition for electronic noses
    (E-nose). In addition to effective feature extraction, the
    architecture of the deep neural network plays a vital role.
    Currently, most applied network structures are hand-crafted by human
    experts, which is timeconsuming and problem-dependent, making it
    necessary to design the structures of neural networks according to
    specific demands. In this work, a genetic algorithm with particle
    swarm optimization (GA-PSO), which possesses promising optimization
    capabilities, is applied to search for effective deep convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs) for gas classification based on E-nose
    technology. A novel image transformation strategy using Gramian
    angular field and a hybrid cost-saving method is employed in the
    search process, enabling adaptive and efficient CNN search on gas
    datasets. With the proposed methods, we can achieve an average
    classification accuracy of over 90 % on two public gas datasets,
    while also significantly reducing the model size compared to
    state-of-the-art CNNs. By using these novel strategies, our approach
    surpasses random search and basic PSO algorithm in achieving the
    global optimal solution, higher and more stable accuracy, and faster
    convergence in pattern recognition using E-nose. Our work suggests
    that the proposed method can quickly identify excellent CNN
    structures for E-nose applications.

        Scaling up Your Kernels: Large Kernel Design in ConvNets towards
        Universal Representations.

    摘要 	This paper proposes the paradigm of large convolutional
    kernels in designing modern Convolutional Neural Networks
    (ConvNets). We establish that employing a few large kernels, instead
    of stacking multiple smaller ones, can be a superior design
    strategy. Our work introduces a set of architecture design
    guidelines for large-kernel ConvNets that optimize their efficiency
    and performance. We propose the UniRepLKNet architecture, which
    offers systematical architecture design principles specifically
    crafted for large-kernel ConvNets, emphasizing their unique ability
    to capture extensive spatial information without deep layer
    stacking. This results in a model that not only surpasses its
    predecessors with an ImageNet accuracy of 88.0%, an ADE20K mIoU of
    55.6%, and a COCO box AP of 56.4% but also demonstrates impressive
    scalability and performance on various modalities such as
    time-series forecasting, audio, point cloud, and video recognition.
    These results indicate the universal modeling abilities of
    large-kernel ConvNets with faster inference speed compared with
    vision transformers. Our findings reveal that large-kernel ConvNets
    possess larger effective receptive fields and a higher shape bias,
    moving away from the texture bias typical of smaller-kernel CNNs.

        SGNet: Sequence Grouping Network via Vision-Language Model for
        Text-Guided Video Summarization

    摘要 	Video summarization can condense the key information in a
    video into a concise format to help viewers quickly grasp the core
    content. Existing approaches typically use a single model to
    generate uniform summaries, ignoring diverse subjective human
    cognition and further widening the semantic gap. Recently,
    multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great promise in
    bridging this gap by leveraging the advanced semantic analysis
    capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and by generating
    high-level concepts that are closely aligned with human cognition.
    As an important subset of MLLMs, vision-language models (VLMs) focus
    on alignment and semantics extraction of visual and textual
    modalities for video summarization. Inspired by human cognition, we
    propose a sequence grouping network (SGNet) via VLM pipeline to
    generate text-guided video summaries aligned with high-level
    concepts. Firstly, a backbone with low-rank and sparsity constraints
    is utilized to extract frame-level features with high value from the
    spatial dimension. Then, sequences of frame-level features are
    grouped along the temporal dimension and processed using a sequence
    Transformer-in-Transformer (S-TNT) to model inter-frame correlations
    and generate compact spatio temporal representations. Finally, the
    text features are obtained from video text description in the VLM

    摘要 	针对流量数据集中类别不平衡限制了分类模型对少数类攻击流量的检测
    性能这一问题，该文提出一种基于联合注意力机制和1维卷积神经网络-双向长
    短期记忆网络(1DCNN-BiLSTM)模型的流量异常检测方法。首先在数据预处理过
    程中利用BorderlineSMOTE方法对流量数据不平衡训练样本预处理，使得各类
    流量数据均衡，有助于后续模型对各类数据的充分训练。然后设计联合注意力
    机制和1DCNN-BiLSTM的模型对流量数据进行训练，提取流量数据的局部和长距
    离序列特征并进行分类，通过注意力机制将对分类有用的特征按其重要性赋予
    权值，提高对少数攻击类的检出率。实验结果表明，同几种现有方法相比，该
    文方法对NSL-KDD和CICIDS2017数据集的检测准确率最高(可达93.17%和
    98.65%)，对NSL-KDD数据集中的提权攻击(U2R)攻击流量的检出率至少提升
    13.70%，证明了该文方法提升少数类攻击流量检出率的有效性。

    摘要 	学习率(learning rate, LR)是深度神经网络(deep neural networks,
    DNNs)能够进行有效训练的重要超参数.然而,学习率的调整在DNNs训练过程中
    仍存在诸多困难与挑战,即使以恒定的学习率选择为目标,为训练DNNs选择一个
    最优的恒定初始学习率也非易事.动态学习率涉及到训练过程的不同阶段,需对
    学习率进行多步调整以达到高精确度和快速收敛的目的:调整过程中学习率过
    小可能会导致模型收敛缓慢或陷入局部最优值;而学习率过大则会阻碍收敛,造
    成震荡发散.对此,综述了近年来基于深度学习算法的学习率研究进展,并对分
    段衰减学习率、平滑衰减学习率、循环学习率、具有热启动的学习率4种类型
    的学习率簇在几个常见数据集上的性能表现进行测试分析和对比研究,包括收
    敛速度、鲁棒性和均值方差等.最后总结全文,并对该领域仍存在的问题以及未
    来的研究趋势进行展望.

    摘要 	随着智能电表等高级量测装置在用户侧的广泛部署与使用，海量多源异
    构的居民用户数据得以采集与存储，为用户级负荷预测提供良好的数据基础。
    精准的居民用户集群负荷预测是促进智能配电网需求侧管理、辅助电网公司实
    现削峰填谷的重要基础。然而，现有的用户级负荷预测方法大多利用历史负荷
    序列的时间相关性构建数据驱动模型，却忽视相邻用户用电行为之间存在的潜
    在空间相关性。因此，提出一种基于K-means聚类和自适应时空同步图卷积神
    经网络的居民用户集群负荷预测方法。首先，采用K-means聚类将居民用户集
    群按照用电行为相似性划分成不同组；然后，基于居民用户集群的分组数量、
    各组居民用户的历史负荷数据以及各组居民用户负荷序列之间的相关性，构建
    面向居民用户集群负荷预测的时空图数据；最后，使用自适应时空同步图卷积
    神经网络实现居民用户集群短期负荷预测。文章通过真实的爱尔兰居民用户负
    荷公开数据集测试并验证所提方法的准确性和有效性，实验结果表明，相较于
    各个基准预测方法，所提方法能够充分挖掘并利用不同居民用户用电负荷之间
    的时空相关性，进而提高居民用户集群负荷预测精度。

    据生成过程中的盲目性弊端，提出改进变分自编码器(improved variational

    摘要 	用户轨迹识别作为一项重要的时空数据挖掘任务，广泛应用于基于位置
    的个性化服务推荐、行程规划、犯罪行为检测和目标跟踪等领域，但依然面临
    预测精度不高的问题，主要原因是轨迹数据低采样且稀疏、轨迹类别数量巨大
    等.针对上述问题提出了基于可拓展自注意力时空图卷积神经网络的用户轨迹
    识别模型（Expandable Self-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph
    Convolutional Neural Networks,ESAST-GCNN），该模型采用时空图卷积神经
    网络方式，深度挖掘时序特征与空间特征关系，并进行预测与拓展，结合自注
    意力机制获取用户轨迹特征向量内部相关性，最终根据该特征向量进行用户轨
    迹身份识别.在两个真实数据集上进行测试后发现，ESAST-GCNN相较于TULER-
    GRU(TUL via Embedding and RNN)在Geolife与Gowalla中准确率分别提高了
    13.95%、10.63%，实验结果表明ESAST-GCNN优于其他模型，识别效果更好，适

    摘要 	牵引电机是高速列车的动力部件，准确诊断牵引电机转子断条故障是保
    障高速列车安全运行的重要手段，也是故障预测和健康管理（PHM）的重要内
    容之一。牵引电机发生转子断条故障时，故障频率与供电频率接近，且幅值
    小，易被掩盖；故障频率变化范围大，导致故障特征尺度变化大，有效特征难
    以提取，诊断结果不准确。为解决这些问题，提出一种基于多尺度特征融合卷
    积神经网络（MSFFCNN）的故障诊断方法。为剔除信号中的电源频率分量，增
    强故障特征，采用希尔伯特变换（HT）对电流进行预处理，并将其转换为图
    像；为适应不同尺度特征，实现有效特征提取，将高效通道注意力（ECA）融
    入多尺度卷积模块，突出有效特征；在此基础上，设计了MSFFCNN模型。在两
    个转子断条故障数据集上进行了实验，平均诊断准确率分别达到了99.85%和
    99.82%。与相关的方法相比，所提诊断方法表现出更强的特征提取能力、抗噪
    能力和泛化性能，能够更为准确识别转子断条故障，为针对性设定牵引电机的
    维修计划提供参考。

    摘要 	多场站多类型源荷功率联合预测场景中，传统的时间序列预测模型难以
    高效提取多类型源荷的时空相关特征和内在隐含联系，导致功率预测精度不
    足。针对该问题，本文提出一种融合改进图卷积神经网络和分组交叉门控机制
    的源荷超短期功率联合预测方法。首先，构建了基于改进型时空图卷积神经网
    络的源荷超短期功率联合预测模型，可充分提取源侧(风电、光伏)与荷侧(电
    负荷、热负荷)功率的时空关联特征。进而，设计了一种分组交叉门控机制并
    集成到改进的图卷积网络中，可使不同类型源荷信息得以交叉调制，有效利用
    了源荷之间的内在隐含联系，从而显著提升了多场站多类型源荷超短期功率联
    合预测的精度。最后，基于我国北部某地区的风光电源和电热负荷数据进行了
    对比实验，结果验证了所提出方法的有效性和优越性。

    摘要 	匹配场处理在高失配、高频率的定位场景中定位性能大幅下降。为此,
    在非相干差频声源定位技术和利用数据驱动的机器学习定位方法的基础上,提
    出了一种基于相干差频信号互谱密度矩阵的卷积神经网络定位方法。该方法使
    用模型和数据双驱动对失配、含噪等场景下的中高频水下声源进行定位。对于
    差频信号,该方法在中心频率维度上对差频信号进行非相干平均以减小交叉项
    的影响,并在差频频率维度上进行堆叠以保留不同频率之间的相关信息,将得到
    的张量数据作为卷积神经网络的输入定位水下声源。使用SwellEx-96仿真环境
    和2021年南海声层析长距离试验的海试数据分别进行了试验,结果表明,所提定
    位算法适用于含噪、存在失配的海洋环境中的中高频声源定位,对水下声源定
    位具有较好的宽容性。

    摘要 	针对实际海域中来自水流、船舶、海洋生物等噪声源的干扰使得接收信
    号的信噪比较低，进而导致传统波达方向(DOA)估计算法性能下降的问题。该
    文提出一种结合维纳滤波降噪的深度学习算法。首先，维纳滤波算法在频域需
    要依靠噪声和信号功率谱，然而这些参数往往难以获取，因此将其转化为对信
    号空间域进行降噪，并使用降噪后的数据集进行神经网络训练，从而减小低信
    噪比条件下对方位角估计的影响。其次，为了实现网络的分类和回归估计功
    能，使用改进的二进制交叉熵函数作为网络的损失函数。最后，在模型训练完
    成后，通过小数标签策略预测网络输出结果中的离格误差，并对这些误差进行
    修正以提高算法估计精度。仿真结果与海试数据验证结果表明，在低信噪比情
    况下，以均方根误差为性能指标，网络整体性能提升了25.20%，在–20 dB信噪
    比条件下，所提方法的均方根误差相较MUSIC和ESPRIT算法分别降低了93.42%
    和92.14%。研究结果表明，本文算法能够充分提取空间特征，满足实际应用对
    算法鲁棒性的需求，为浅海复杂环境的目标检测和定位任务提供了新的方案。

    摘要 	针对隐私保护卷积神经网络预测,先前的研究采用同态加密、安全多方
    计算等方法来保护客户端隐私敏感数据.然而,这些方法通常面临预测时间开销

    线性层高效安全计算,并缓解了近似处理而导致的预测准确率损失.在线性层和

    摘要 	入侵检测系统（intrusion detection system,IDS）是保障网络环境安
    全的重要手段，但传统深度学习方法在应对非频繁攻击特征与数据不平衡问题
    时存在高误报率，且对高维稀疏特征建模能力有限.随着物联网与边缘设备的
    普及，入侵检测数据呈现出分布式与异构化趋势，且因隐私保护要求，原始数
    据难以集中训练.为此，提出了一种融合联邦学习与量子卷积神经网络的入侵
    检测模型FedCQIDS(federated classical hybrid quantum convolutional
    intrusion detection system），在客户端本地模型中引入轻量化的量子卷积
    层，通过量子比特复用技术提升资源利用率，增强对低频稀疏攻击特征的表达
    能力，并借助联邦学习架构实现多客户端间的协同建模与隐私保护.在NSL-KDD
    与UNSW-NB15两个数据集上开展了相关的实验，结果表明Fed CQIDS在准确率与
    损失值方面均优于传统联邦模型，特别是在少数类攻击识别任务中表现出更高
    的检测性能与训练稳定性，展示了其在隐私保护与高效部署下的应用潜力.

    摘要 	近年来,卷积神经网络(Convolutional neural network, CNNs)在计算
    机视觉、自然语言处理、语音识别等领域取得了突飞猛进的发展,其强大的特
    征学习能力引起了国内外专家学者广泛关注.然而,由于深度卷积神经网络普遍
    规模庞大、计算度复杂,限制了其在实时要求高和资源受限环境下的应用.对卷
    积神经网络的结构进行优化以压缩并加速现有网络有助于深度学习在更大范围
    的推广应用,目前已成为深度学习社区的一个研究热点.本文整理了卷积神经网

    摘要 	本文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络(Convolutional Neural Network，
    CNN)与改进Vision Transformer（VIT）的涡旋光束叠加态轨道角动量
    (Orbital Angular Momentum， OAM)模式识别方法。以海洋湍流畸变的三组拉
    盖尔-高斯光束模式叠加光场强度分布图为输入，有机整合了CNN的局部特征提
    取优势与稀疏注意力机制驱动的VIT的全局快速分类能力，实现端到端的波前
    畸变高效精准识别。通过数值仿真模拟海洋湍流环境叠加态OAM模式，利用功
    率谱反演法模拟海洋湍流，以识别准确率和混淆矩阵作为OAM模式识别的评估
    指标。实验结果表明，CNN-VIT模型在不同海洋湍流强度、波长、传输距离和
    模式间隔条件下均展现出优异的OAM模式识别准确率性能。与现有的CNN和VIT
    相比，本文模型在强海洋湍流条件下识别准确率分别提升了23.5%和9.65%。这
    证明了CNN-VIT模型在涡旋光叠加态OAM模式识别的应用潜力。

    结构信息.其次将经过预处理的脑电图和功能性近红外光谱数据分别输入卷积
    层.再次将这些由卷积层输出的特征信息和图结构信息输入动态图卷积神经网
    络进行处理.进一步通过一层时间卷积分别提取两种数据的时间特征,将输出结
    果进行拼接输入至一层卷积中进行特征层面融合.最后通过全连接层得到融合
    后的分类结果.为评估提出模型的性能,采用三个数据集:A、B、C进行测试.实
    验结果表明:本模型在三个数据集的分类结果分别为78.45%、86.60%、84.77%,
    均优于脑电图分类结果75.09%、82.53%、83.08%和功能性近红外光谱分类结果

        基于全局局部协同的非均匀图像去雾方法

    摘要 	近年来,基于卷积神经网络(Convolutional neural network, CNN)的图
    像去雾方法在合成数据集上取得了显著的进展,但由于真实场景中存在雾分布
    不均的问题,卷积运算的局部感受野难以有效捕获到上下文指导信息,从而导致
    全局结构信息丢失.因此,真实场景下的图像去雾任务面临着巨大的挑战.考虑
    到Transformer具有捕获长距离语义信息依赖关系的优势,有利于引导全局结构
    信息重建.然而,标准Transformer结构的高计算复杂度阻碍了其在图像恢复中
    的应用.针对上述提到的问题,提出一个由Transformer和卷积神经网络组成的
    双分支协同非均匀图像去雾网络Dehazeformer.Transformer分支用于提取全局
    结构信息,同时设计稀疏自注意力模块(Sparse self-attention modules,
    SSM)以降低计算复杂度.卷积神经网络分支用于获取局部信息,从而恢复纹理细
    节.在真实非均匀有雾场景下的实验结果表明,该方法不管是在客观评价还是在
    主观视觉效果方面均达到优异的性能.
